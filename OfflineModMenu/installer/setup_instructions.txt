Offline Mod Menu â€” VonDutch Edition
===================================

Build Requirements
------------------
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
2. Install vcpkg and integrate it with Visual Studio or keep the VCPKG_ROOT environment variable handy.
3. From a Developer Command Prompt, navigate to the project root.

Building with build.bat
-----------------------
1. Run build.bat.
2. The script will create a build directory, configure CMake with the vcpkg toolchain, and compile the Release configuration.
3. When complete, OfflineModMenu.exe is available under build/Release/.

Runtime Disclaimer
------------------
This software is intended strictly for offline, singleplayer titles you own. Never attach to multiplayer or online experiences. You must confirm "YES I OWN THIS COPY" at runtime before any modifications are made.

Installer Notes
---------------
The installer CMake project packages the compiled executable with resources, default configs, and the mods folder. Execute CMake within the installer directory after building the main project to create a distributable bundle.
